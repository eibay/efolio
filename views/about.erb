Welcome to my new home online. My churchmates and friends simply call me by my first name, Elmer. I am blessed with 3 children named: Yanah, Ice and Elijel. I am happily married to Eeyan for 11 years now. I was born in Manila but raised in Quezon City by my very responsible and hardworking parents, Adolfo and Lourdes together living with my only older brother, Albert. I finished my diploma in Electronics Technology in 1995 as full-time scholar from Meralco Foundation Institute. Right after graduation, I was successfully employed as an electronics technician at Allegro Microsystems. While working, I pursued my degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering from Technological University of the Philippines and graduated in 1999. By the year 2001, I moved to Singapore and discovered the importance of having a true relationship with Jesus Christ. Several years later, I met my wife who happened to be a believer as well. We got married in 2004 and entrusted with 3 wonderful children. This year of 2015, another blessing and new chapter of our life begins as we explore our new home which God is calling us to go and occupy. God willing, our family is moving to Melbourne Australia by the end of this year. I thank God for all the wonderful provisions He has given me eversince I've known Him for the past 15 years. Indeed, without Him, I will never bear fruit because apart from Him, I can do nothing.
